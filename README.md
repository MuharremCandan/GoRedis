Redis: Fast and Flexible
Key-Value Database

Redis is an in-memory key-value database that provides high performance by storing data in memory. It is an ideal choice for web applications, offering solutions for caching, real-time analytics, and sequential data structures. With its simple, fast, and flexible structure, Redis caters to various use cases. It ensures reliable data storage with features like high availability and durability. Redis is an excellent choice for those seeking to optimize data management in applications that demand speed.

Installing Redis on Docker
Let's start by running Redis on Docker. The following command initializes a Redis container (make sure Docker is installed on your machine):

docker run --name redisapp -p 6379:6379 redis

Access the Redis CLI with the following command:

docker exec -it redisapp redis-cli

Redis Commands
Let's understand the functionality of Redis by using some basic commands in the Redis CLI:

keys *: Lists all keys.
set name muharrem: Sets the value of the "name" key to "muharrem".
get name: Retrieves the value of the "name" key.
hset user name muharrem: Sets the value of the "name" sub-key under the "user" key to "muharrem".
hgetall user: Retrieves all sub-keys and values under the "user" key.


-Connecting to Redis with Golang

In Golang, we can communicate with Redis using the github.com/go-redis/redis package.

This code serves as a starting point for integrating Golang with Redis. You can expand and customize it according to your project's needs.

Feel free to use and modify this code in your GitHub repository's README for documentation purposes.

Happy coding! ðŸš€
